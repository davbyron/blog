            "title": "A Comparison of TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Transfer Learning for Text Classification",
            "content": "Text Classification is the assignment of a particular label to a text with respect to its content. In modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), there are many different algorithms and techniques used to gain significant accuracy in text classification tasks. . In this notebook, we will cover three of the most popular methods for text classification: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and transfer learning. For each of the three methods, we will also show their effectiveness based on the amount of preprocessing that is done to the text beforehand, leaving us with a total of nine measurements at the end. . We will see that transfer learning is by far the superior method for the task in terms of ease of use and accuracy. . The data that we will be using comes from Kaggle&#39;s &quot;Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets&quot; competition, where the user is tasked with predicting which tweets are about real disasters, and which ones are not. . In the competition, leaderboard position is based on the model&#39;s F1 score. Therefore, for clarity, we will provide both the accuracy and F1 score for each output below. . To begin, let&#39;s start with some data analysis and augmentation: . Data Analysis, Augmentation, and Splitting . Light Analysis . import pandas as pd . . First, let&#39;s take a look at the training data we&#39;re given: . data = pd.read_csv(&#39;train.csv&#39;) data.head() . id keyword location text target . 0 1 | NaN | NaN | Our Deeds are the Reason of this #earthquake M... | 1 | . 1 4 | NaN | NaN | Forest fire near La Ronge Sask. Canada | 1 | . 2 5 | NaN | NaN | All residents asked to &#39;shelter in place&#39; are ... | 1 | . 3 6 | NaN | NaN | 13,000 people receive #wildfires evacuation or... | 1 | . 4 7 | NaN | NaN | Just got sent this photo from Ruby #Alaska as ... | 1 | . To find out a bit more information about the data, we can use the .info() and .nunique() methods on our DataFrame: . data.info() . &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt; RangeIndex: 7613 entries, 0 to 7612 Data columns (total 5 columns): # Column Non-Null Count Dtype -- -- 0 id 7613 non-null int64 1 keyword 7552 non-null object 2 location 5080 non-null object 3 text 7613 non-null object 4 target 7613 non-null int64 dtypes: int64(2), object(3) memory usage: 297.5+ KB . data.nunique() . id 7613 keyword 221 location 3341 text 7503 target 2 dtype: int64 . Interesting! It looks like some of the tweets (110 of them, to be precise) are the same. . Data Augmentation . Cleaning . import re import spacy . . As mentioned above, I will incorporate different methods of preprocessing to our data to see if such changes have a positive or negative effect on our evaluation metrics. The three differently processed data I&#39;ll be using are: . Unprocessed - the data as it is given to us. | &quot;Simply&quot; cleaned - the data without any hashtags, @-symbols, website links, or punctuation. | SpaCy cleaned - the data lemmatized and without any stop words according to SpaCy&#39;s pretrained English language model (which we&#39;ll get to in a moment). | The unprocessed data is already done for us in the text column of our DataFrame. . Moving on to the second preprocessing method, &quot;simply&quot; cleaned data. By &quot;simply&quot; I mean cleaned explicitly by me using regular expressions with prior assumptions about the data. For the data we&#39;re using here, we have a bunch of tweets. Thererfore, it makes sense to me to remove things like hashtags, @-symbols, and websites, since those don&#39;t intuitively seem like they contribute to a tweets disaster level (though this isn&#39;t necessarily true, just an assumption!). . To achieve this &quot;simple&quot; cleaning of the data, we can use the following three functions I&#39;ve created: . def remove_at_hash(sent): &quot;&quot;&quot; Returns a string with @-symbols and hashtags removed. &quot;&quot;&quot; return re.sub(r&#39;@|#&#39;, r&#39;&#39;, sent.lower()) def remove_sites(sent): &quot;&quot;&quot; Returns a string with any websites starting with &#39;http.&#39; removed. &quot;&quot;&quot; return re.sub(r&#39;http.*&#39;, r&#39;&#39;, sent.lower()) def remove_punct(sent): &quot;&quot;&quot; Returns a string with only English unicode word characters ([a-zA-Z0-9_]). &quot;&quot;&quot; return &#39; &#39;.join(re.findall(r&#39; w+&#39;, sent.lower())) . Now we can create a new column in our data DataFrame that represents the &quot;simply&quot; cleaned tweets. I&#39;ll call this column text_simple. . data[&#39;text_simple&#39;] = data[&#39;text&#39;].apply(lambda x: remove_punct(remove_sites(remove_at_hash(x)))) data.head() . id keyword location text target text_simple . 0 1 | NaN | NaN | Our Deeds are the Reason of this #earthquake M... | 1 | our deeds are the reason of this earthquake ma... | . 1 4 | NaN | NaN | Forest fire near La Ronge Sask. Canada | 1 | forest fire near la ronge sask canada | . 2 5 | NaN | NaN | All residents asked to &#39;shelter in place&#39; are ... | 1 | all residents asked to shelter in place are be... | . 3 6 | NaN | NaN | 13,000 people receive #wildfires evacuation or... | 1 | 13 000 people receive wildfires evacuation ord... | . 4 7 | NaN | NaN | Just got sent this photo from Ruby #Alaska as ... | 1 | just got sent this photo from ruby alaska as s... | . Moving now to the last preprocessing method: SpaCy. SpaCy is a great, open-source software library for NLP. It includes varying, pretrained language models of a number of different sizes for a number of different langauges, allowing you to quickly perform routine NLP tasks. Here, we&#39;re going to use SpaCy to lemmatize each tweet in the data and remove any stop words. . Below, we need to first load in SpaCy&#39;s (full) English model (note that, for speed, I disable some features that we won&#39;t need here). Then, create a function that will give us a string lemmatized by SpaCy. . nlp = spacy.load(&#39;en&#39;, disable=[&#39;ner&#39;, &#39;parser&#39;]) # disabling features we don&#39;t need, for speed def spacy_cleaning(doc): &quot;&quot;&quot; Returns a string that has been lemmatized and rid of stop words via SpaCy. &quot;&quot;&quot; doc = nlp(doc.lower()) text = [token.lemma_ for token in doc if not token.is_stop] return &#39; &#39;.join(text) . Using our new function, we can again create a new column in our data DataFrame with the SpaCy-cleaned tweets. I&#39;ll call this column text_spacy. . data[&#39;text_spacy&#39;] = data[&#39;text&#39;].apply(lambda x: spacy_cleaning(x)) data.head() . id keyword location text target text_simple text_spacy . 0 1 | NaN | NaN | Our Deeds are the Reason of this #earthquake M... | 1 | our deeds are the reason of this earthquake ma... | deed reason # earthquake allah forgive | . 1 4 | NaN | NaN | Forest fire near La Ronge Sask. Canada | 1 | forest fire near la ronge sask canada | forest fire near la ronge sask . canada | . 2 5 | NaN | NaN | All residents asked to &#39;shelter in place&#39; are ... | 1 | all residents asked to shelter in place are be... | resident ask &#39; shelter place &#39; notify officer ... | . 3 6 | NaN | NaN | 13,000 people receive #wildfires evacuation or... | 1 | 13 000 people receive wildfires evacuation ord... | 13,000 people receive # wildfire evacuation or... | . 4 7 | NaN | NaN | Just got sent this photo from Ruby #Alaska as ... | 1 | just got sent this photo from ruby alaska as s... | get send photo ruby # alaska smoke # wildfire ... | . n-grams . from gensim.models.phrases import Phrases, Phraser . . . Important: I&#8217;ll only be applying what we learn in the n-gram section to the Word2Vec model. If you&#8217;d like to skip this section, and come back when you get to Word2Vec, feel free to do so. . An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. This turns out to be quite useful in NLP. Consider the phrase &quot;New York Times&quot;. When all three words are together, the phrase is understood to mean the widely spread news source based in New York of the same moniker. However, if we split the words up (while maintaining original order), we get: &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;York Times&quot;, &quot;New&quot;, &quot;York&quot;, and &quot;Times&quot;. These separate words and phrases can occur in many contexts other than those in which the full phrase &quot;New York Times&quot; is found, skewing the phrase&#39;s true meaning in the data. N-gram models allow us to concatenate these commonly occurring multi-word phrases in our data, allowing their true meaning to shine through. . Thankfully, we can use the Phraser and Phrases classes provided by gensim in order to easily find n-grams in our data. . Let&#39;s start by getting trigrams found in the unprocessed data. . First, we extract the tweets and split them by whitespace characters. . text = [re.split(&#39; s+&#39;, tweet) for tweet in data[&#39;text&#39;]] . Then, we find bigrams throughout our data. Here we use a parameter of min_count=30 for our Phrases class. This ensures that only bigrams that occur more than 30 times in the data are found. Many combinations of words occur side by side only a few times, and don&#39;t contribute much additional knowledge to our model, so this is important. . bigram_phrases = Phrases(text, min_count=30) bigram = Phraser(bigram_phrases) bigram_text = bigram[text] . Next, we can use the bigrams we just made to search for trigrams in the exact same way. . Note: This is repeatable! Keep going to find n-grams of size 5 if you wanted! . trigram_phrases = Phrases(bigram_text, min_count=30) trigram = Phraser(trigram_phrases) trigram_text = trigram[bigram_text] . That&#39;s it! Now we can pop this list back into our data DataFrame to be used later. . data[&#39;text_trigram&#39;] = [&#39; &#39;.join(tweet) for tweet in trigram_text] data.head() . id keyword location text target text_simple text_spacy text_trigram . 0 1 | NaN | NaN | Our Deeds are the Reason of this #earthquake M... | 1 | our deeds are the reason of this earthquake ma... | deed reason # earthquake allah forgive | Our Deeds are the Reason of this #earthquake M... | . 1 4 | NaN | NaN | Forest fire near La Ronge Sask. Canada | 1 | forest fire near la ronge sask canada | forest fire near la ronge sask . canada | Forest fire near La Ronge Sask. Canada | . 2 5 | NaN | NaN | All residents asked to &#39;shelter in place&#39; are ... | 1 | all residents asked to shelter in place are be... | resident ask &#39; shelter place &#39; notify officer ... | All residents asked to &#39;shelter in place&#39; are ... | . 3 6 | NaN | NaN | 13,000 people receive #wildfires evacuation or... | 1 | 13 000 people receive wildfires evacuation ord... | 13,000 people receive # wildfire evacuation or... | 13,000 people receive #wildfires evacuation or... | . 4 7 | NaN | NaN | Just got sent this photo from Ruby #Alaska as ... | 1 | just got sent this photo from ruby alaska as s... | get send photo ruby # alaska smoke # wildfire ... | Just got sent this photo from Ruby #Alaska as ... | . Great work! Now let&#39;s do the same for the text_simple and text_spacy columns. . text_simple = [re.split(&#39; s+&#39;, tweet) for tweet in data[&#39;text_simple&#39;]] bigram_phrases = Phrases(text_simple, min_count=30) bigram = Phraser(bigram_phrases) bigram_text_simple = bigram[text_simple] trigram_phrases = Phrases(bigram_text_simple, min_count=30) trigram = Phraser(trigram_phrases) trigram_text_simple = trigram[bigram_text_simple] data[&#39;text_trigram_simple&#39;] = [&#39; &#39;.join(tweet) for tweet in trigram_text_simple] . . text_spacy = [re.split(&#39; s+&#39;, tweet) for tweet in data[&#39;text_spacy&#39;]] bigram_phrases = Phrases(text_spacy, min_count=30) bigram = Phraser(bigram_phrases) bigram_text_spacy = bigram[text_spacy] trigram_phrases = Phrases(bigram_text_spacy, min_count=30) trigram = Phraser(trigram_phrases) trigram_text_spacy = trigram[bigram_text_spacy] data[&#39;text_trigram_spacy&#39;] = [&#39; &#39;.join(tweet) for tweet in trigram_text_spacy] . . data.head() . id keyword location text target text_simple text_spacy text_trigram text_trigram_simple text_trigram_spacy . 0 1 | NaN | NaN | Our Deeds are the Reason of this #earthquake M... | 1 | our deeds are the reason of this earthquake ma... | deed reason # earthquake allah forgive | Our Deeds are the Reason of this #earthquake M... | our deeds are the reason of this earthquake ma... | deed reason # earthquake allah forgive | . 1 4 | NaN | NaN | Forest fire near La Ronge Sask. Canada | 1 | forest fire near la ronge sask canada | forest fire near la ronge sask . canada | Forest fire near La Ronge Sask. Canada | forest fire near la ronge sask canada | forest fire near la ronge sask . canada | . 2 5 | NaN | NaN | All residents asked to &#39;shelter in place&#39; are ... | 1 | all residents asked to shelter in place are be... | resident ask &#39; shelter place &#39; notify officer ... | All residents asked to &#39;shelter in place&#39; are ... | all residents asked to shelter in place are be... | resident ask &#39; shelter place &#39; notify officer ... | . 3 6 | NaN | NaN | 13,000 people receive #wildfires evacuation or... | 1 | 13 000 people receive wildfires evacuation ord... | 13,000 people receive # wildfire evacuation or... | 13,000 people receive #wildfires evacuation or... | 13 000 people receive wildfires evacuation ord... | 13,000 people receive # wildfire evacuation or... | . 4 7 | NaN | NaN | Just got sent this photo from Ruby #Alaska as ... | 1 | just got sent this photo from ruby alaska as s... | get send photo ruby # alaska smoke # wildfire ... | Just got sent this photo from Ruby #Alaska as ... | just got sent this photo from ruby alaska as s... | get send photo ruby # alaska smoke # wildfire ... | . Fantastic! We&#39;ve found all of the trigrams and bigrams in each of our three datasets that occur more than 30 times. This data will prove to be very useful when we reach Word2Vec. . Now that we&#39;ve got the three separately preprocessed sets of tweets in neat columns in our dataset, it&#39;s time to split our data into training and validation data and begin our testing! . Splitting . from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split . . In order to properly test our data, we&#39;ll need to split it into training and validation sets. To do this, we simply pass our data DataFrame to sklearn&#39;s train_test_split. We reset the index of each newly-created DataFrame to avoid complications with indexing later on. Then, check the shapes to make everything adds up. . train, valid = train_test_split(data) train = train.reset_index() valid = valid.reset_index() train.shape, valid.shape, data.shape . ((5709, 11), (1904, 11), (7613, 10)) . Things are looking good! One last preprocessing step is in order, and that is dividing our newly-created train data by their target labels, thereby giving us two new DataFrames representing disaster tweets and non-disaster tweets. . When we call .nunique() on both disasters and not_disasters, we can see that the unique number of targets in each DataFrame is 1, indicating we split the data properly. . disasters = train[train[&#39;target&#39;] == 1].reset_index() not_disasters = train[train[&#39;target&#39;] == 0].reset_index() disasters.nunique(), not_disasters.nunique() . (level_0 2484 index 2484 id 2484 keyword 219 location 1201 text 2440 target 1 text_simple 2181 text_spacy 2439 text_trigram 2439 text_trigram_simple 2181 text_trigram_spacy 2438 dtype: int64, level_0 3225 index 3225 id 3225 keyword 216 location 1657 text 3210 target 1 text_simple 3047 text_spacy 3209 text_trigram 3210 text_trigram_simple 3047 text_trigram_spacy 3209 dtype: int64) . Awesome! We&#39;re all set and we can begin to train our models. . Let&#39;s start with TF-IDF. . TF-IDF . from collections import defaultdict from gensim.corpora import Dictionary from gensim.models import TfidfModel from gensim.similarities import MatrixSimilarity import numpy as np from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score . . TF-IDF is an incredible, straightforward way to analyze document similarity. It involves no fancy machine learning, just the term frequency across documents! For this reason, we will begin with trying to use TF-IDF to determine if a tweet is about a disaster or not. . From tfidf.com: . Tf-idf stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency, and the tf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. . You can learn more about the mathematical foundations of TF-IDF here. We&#39;ll start by analyzing the unprocessed tweets. . TF-IDF with Unprocessed Tweets . In order to calculate the similarity between two tweets (namely, a tweet in the validation set with a tweet in the training set) without having to do all the math out ourselves, we&#39;ll use gensim, a free Python library that provides a lot of great NLP functionality. . Gensim requires a list of texts in a list of documents. For us, that&#39;s a list of words in a tweet in a list of tweets. So let&#39;s make that now. . Note: We&#8217;re using the unprocessed tweets in the data[&amp;#8217;text&amp;#8217;] column this time around. We&#8217;ll be using the other two preprocessed tweets in a bit! . disaster_tweets = disasters[&#39;text&#39;].tolist() not_disaster_tweets = not_disasters[&#39;text&#39;].tolist() disaster_tweets_split = [ [word for word in tweet.split()] for tweet in disaster_tweets ] not_disaster_tweets_split = [ [word for word in tweet.split()] for tweet in not_disaster_tweets ] . Thinking about a TF-IDF model, words that only occur once throughout the entire corpus will not provide any noteworthy advantage to the model. Therefore, in the next step, we remove words that only occur once from disaster_tweets_split and not_disaster_tweets split. . disaster_tweets_word_frequency = defaultdict(int) for tweet in disaster_tweets_split: for word in tweet: disaster_tweets_word_frequency[word] += 1 not_disaster_tweets_word_frequency = defaultdict(int) for tweet in not_disaster_tweets_split: for word in tweet: not_disaster_tweets_word_frequency[word] += 1 disaster_tweets_split = [ [word for word in tweet if disaster_tweets_word_frequency[word] &gt; 1] for tweet in disaster_tweets_split ] not_disaster_tweets_split = [ [word for word in tweet if not_disaster_tweets_word_frequency[word] &gt; 1] for tweet in not_disaster_tweets_split ] . Next, we create a Dictionary object with gensim, which is a mapping between words and their integer ids. With this Dictionary object we can create a &quot;corpus&quot; for disaster tweets and non-disaster tweets by converting each document (i.e., tweet) in each set to a Bag of Words format (that is, a list of (token_id, token_count) tuples). . disaster_tweets_dct = Dictionary(disaster_tweets_split) not_disaster_tweets_dct = Dictionary(not_disaster_tweets_split) disaster_tweets_corpus = [disaster_tweets_dct.doc2bow(tweet) for tweet in disaster_tweets_split] not_disaster_tweets_corpus = [not_disaster_tweets_dct.doc2bow(tweet) for tweet in not_disaster_tweets_split] . Fit TF-IDF models for our two sets of tweets. . disaster_tweets_tfidf = TfidfModel(disaster_tweets_corpus) not_disaster_tweets_tfidf = TfidfModel(not_disaster_tweets_corpus) . Apply the models to our corpora to get vectors for each tweet. . disaster_tweets_tfidf_vectors = disaster_tweets_tfidf[disaster_tweets_corpus] not_disaster_tweets_tfidf_vectors = not_disaster_tweets_tfidf[not_disaster_tweets_corpus] . Create variable which we can index into using another vector to compute similarity. . disaster_tweets_similarity = MatrixSimilarity(disaster_tweets_tfidf_vectors) not_disaster_tweets_similarity = MatrixSimilarity(not_disaster_tweets_tfidf_vectors) . Now we can compare each tweet in the validation set to each set of tweets (disaster and non-disaster) in the training set. Whichever set contains a greater number of &quot;similar enough&quot; tweets (to be determined by a threshold) determines how the validation tweet will be labeled. . First, configure the validation tweets in the same way that we did for the training tweets: . valid_tweets = valid[&#39;text&#39;].tolist() valid_tweets_split = [ [word for word in tweet.split()] for tweet in valid_tweets ] valid_tweets_word_frequency = defaultdict(int) for tweet in valid_tweets_split: for word in tweet: valid_tweets_word_frequency[word] += 1 valid_tweets_split = [ [word for word in tweet if valid_tweets_word_frequency[word] &gt; 1] for tweet in valid_tweets_split ] . We now have all the information we need to make our predictions! We can store our predictions in the valid DataFrame. This will make for easier access when comparing target to prediction. . To do that, we need to initialize a new column in the DataFrame, let&#39;s call it prediction: . valid[&#39;prediction&#39;] = np.zeros(len(valid)).astype(&#39;int&#39;) . In order to make predictions using the model we just created, we have to compare each tweet in the validation data with each tweet in both the disasters DataFrame and the not_disasters DataFrame. . Therefore, for each tweet, we: . Turn it into a BoW according to each set of tweets&#39; Dictionary object. | Get a vector for it using each set&#39;s TF-IDF model. | Compare it&#39;s vector with each set&#39;s full set of tweets using the MatrixSimilarity object we created earleir. | Tally up the total number of disaster and non-disaster tweets whose cosine similarity is greater than 0.1. | If the disaster tally is greater than the non-disaster tally, we change the value of the prediction column for this tweet in the valid DataFrame to 1 (otherwise, it stays 0, indicating a non-disastrous guess). | This is exemplefied below: . for row in range(len(valid)): tweet = valid_tweets_split[row] tweet_bow_with_disasters_dct = disaster_tweets_dct.doc2bow(tweet) tweet_bow_with_not_disasters_dct = not_disaster_tweets_dct.doc2bow(tweet) tweet_tfidf_vector_with_disasters_tfidf = disaster_tweets_tfidf[tweet_bow_with_disasters_dct] tweet_tfidf_vector_with_not_disasters_tfidf = not_disaster_tweets_tfidf[tweet_bow_with_not_disasters_dct] disaster_similarity_vector = disaster_tweets_similarity[tweet_tfidf_vector_with_disasters_tfidf] not_disaster_similarity_vector = not_disaster_tweets_similarity[tweet_tfidf_vector_with_not_disasters_tfidf] disaster_tally = np.where(disaster_similarity_vector &gt; 0.1)[0].size # np.where() returns a tuple, so we have to index into [0] to get what we want not_disaster_tally = np.where(not_disaster_similarity_vector &gt; 0.1)[0].size if disaster_tally &gt; not_disaster_tally: valid.loc[row, &#39;prediction&#39;] = 1 .

The second method for text classification that we&#39;ll use is word vectors. . Word vectors were first introduced by Mikolov et al.[1][2] and provide highly accurate results in word similarity tasks at relatively low computational cost. You can think of a word vector as a 1-dimensional matrix of numbers of some arbitrary length computed by neural networks. Word similarity is then determined by the cosine distance between two vectors. . Word vectors, interestingly, can encode linguistic regularities and patterns. Therefore, many of these patterns can be represented as linear translations. For example vector(king) - vector(man) + vector(woman) is going to very close to vector(queen). This is surprising! . Let&#39;s see how word vectors do at predicting disaster tweets. . Word2Vec Preprocessing . We&#39;ll be using gensim&#39;s Word2Vec module, which processes text using a min_count parameter. This parameter only includes words in the input that occur more than the set min_count number of times. This will cause problems later on when trying to classify the tweets in the validation set because some of the words will have occurred less than the min_count parameter, throwing an &quot;out-of-vocabulary&quot; (OOV) error. . In order to remedy this, we have two options: . Train the Word2Vec model and then remove the words from the validation tweets that are not in the trained vocabulary. | Preemptively change the words in our corpus that occur less than the expected min_count number of times with some sort of &quot;unknown&quot; character. | Both of these methods alter the original tweet that we&#39;ll be classifying, but the latter option seems to adhere closer to the original meaning of the tweet. If we drop words, we could make an entirely new sentence with an enitrely new grammatical structure and meaning. Whereas if we replace the words that occur less than min_count amount of times with an unknown character, the original grammatical structure of each sentence is held in tact, creating a closer tie to the tweet&#39;s original meaning. . To do this efficiently, I&#39;ve created a function replace_unknowns() that replaces the words in a text which occur less than a specified min_count number of times with &#39;UNK&#39;. We can use this to alter the preprocessed columns that we made earlier and store them in our original data DataFrame. . def replace_unknowns(search_texts, min_count): &quot;&quot;&quot; Replaces words that occur less than a certain number of times in a string or list of strings with &#39;UNK&#39;. Parameters - search_texts : list A list of input strings to iterate over. min_count : int An integer specify the minimum count a word should occur in the search_texts to not be replaced with &#39;UNK&#39;. Returns - list List of search_texts with words that occur less than the min_count amount of times replaced with &#39;UNK&#39;. &quot;&quot;&quot; # Get all tweets lowered and tokenized. # This makes sense because we&#39;d never want to # treat an &#39;a&#39; different from an &#39;A&#39;. # (Capitalization is just an orthographical convention) texts = [ [word for word in re.split(&#39; s+&#39;, text.lower())] for text in search_texts ] # create a dictionary that stores the count of each # word in our uncleaned tweets. We can insert new words # into the dict or add to their count if their already in it. vocab_counts = defaultdict(int) # Create a list that we can append words that occur more than # the desired threshold number of times to. vocab = [] for text in texts: for word in text: vocab_counts[word] += 1 # Now go through the vocab_counts and get rid of # words that occur less than five times. for word in vocab_counts.keys(): if vocab_counts[word] &gt; min_count: vocab.append(word) # Now initialize a new column in data that will hold # the tweets with &#39;UNK&#39; replacing words that occur # across the entire vocabulary less than five times. # This creates congruency later on in the model. # data[&#39;text_count_5&#39;] = np.empty(len(data), dtype=str) # ***** DO THIS OUTSIDE FUNC IN WORD2VEC SECTION # Now, go through each tweet and replace the words that # occur less than 5 times throughout the entire corpus # with &#39;UNK&#39;. Then, we insert the new tweet into a new # column in the original dataframe. out = [] # this process takes about a minute for i, text in enumerate(texts): text_replaced = [] for word in text: if word in vocab: text_replaced.append(word) else: text_replaced.append(&#39;UNK&#39;) text_replaced = &#39; &#39;.join(text_replaced) out.append(text_replaced) return out . . Below, we&#39;ll use min_count=5 as one of our hyperparameters) in our Word2Vec model, so let&#39;s replace all of the words in all three of our preprocessed tweet columns (text_trigram, text_trigram_simple, and text_trigram_spacy) in each DataFrame with &#39;UNK&#39;. . Note: Remember! We&#8217;re using the trigrams we built in the Data Augmentation section. If you skipped it, go back now! . Note: Normally this would happen during the initial preprocessing stage, allowing us to only need to call replace_unknowns() on our initial data DataFrame. Because we&#8217;re calling replace_unknowns() after we&#8217;ve already split our data into training and validation sets, we need to call the function on all of the DataFrames we&#8217;ve already created. . data[&#39;text_count_5&#39;] = replace_unknowns(data[&#39;text_trigram&#39;], 5) data[&#39;text_simple_5&#39;] = replace_unknowns(data[&#39;text_trigram_simple&#39;], 5) data[&#39;text_spacy_5&#39;] = replace_unknowns(data[&#39;text_trigram_spacy&#39;], 5) data.head() . . id keyword location text target text_simple text_spacy text_trigram text_trigram_simple text_trigram_spacy text_count_5 text_simple_5 text_spacy_5 . 0 1 | NaN | NaN | Our Deeds are the Reason of this #earthquake M... | 1 | our deeds are the reason of this earthquake ma... | deed reason # earthquake allah forgive | Our Deeds are the Reason of this #earthquake M... | our deeds are the reason of this earthquake ma... | deed reason # earthquake allah forgive | our UNK are the reason of this #earthquake may... | our UNK are the reason of this earthquake may ... | UNK reason # earthquake allah UNK | . 1 4 | NaN | NaN | Forest fire near La Ronge Sask.

Initialize our Word2Vec model. . Note: I&#8217;m splitting up the training of the model into three steps. See this notebook for more details on why (and Word2Vec in general). . model = Word2Vec(min_count=5, sample=1e-3, workers=4) . Build the vocab for our model. . The .build_vocab() method expects an iterable of a list of strings as its input, so first we split our tweets to adhere to that. Notice that we&#39;re looping through all of the tweets in our original data DataFrame rather than the train DataFrame we created. This is because we need the vocabulary of all tweets (in both the training and validation data) in order to properly compare tweets in the training data to tweets in the validation data. If we just built our model on the training data, many of the words in the validation tweets would throw OOV errors! . tweets = [ [wd for wd in tweet.split(&#39; &#39;)] for tweet in data[&#39;text_count_5&#39;] ] model.build_vocab(tweets) . Now we can train the model over 30 epochs (cycles). . model.train(tweets, total_examples=model.corpus_count, epochs=30) . (2006980, 3383040) . Now we normalize vectors in the vocaulary for consistency. . Important: You wouldn&#8217;t do this if you were going to train further down the line. See this notebook for more information about expanding your model&#8217;s vocabulary. . model.wv.init_sims(replace=True) . Now we can make our predictions. . Just as when we were doing TF-IDF, we need to initialize a prediction column in the valid DataFrame to store our predictions. . valid[&#39;prediction&#39;] = np.zeros(len(valid)).astype(&#39;int&#39;) . Similar to how we predicted whether a tweet was a disaster or not with TF-IDF, we have to compare each tweet in the validation data with each tweet in both the disasters DataFrame and the not_disasters DataFrame. . So, this time, for each tweet, we: . Split the validation tweet on all whitespace characters. | Calculate the similarity between the validation tweet and each disaster and non-disaster tweet (also split on whitespace characters). | If the similarity between the two tweets is greater than 0.7, add to that tweet set&#39;s tally. | If the disaster tally is gerater than the non-disaster tally, we change the value of the prediction column for the validation tweet to 1 (otherwise, it remains 0, indicating a non-disastrous guess). | This is exemplified below: . Important: This model takes a little bit of time to train. It took almost 16 minutes on my machine. . start_time = time.time() for valid_row in range(len(valid)): valid_tweet = valid.loc[valid_row, &#39;text_count_5&#39;] tokenized_valid_tweet = re.split(&#39; s+&#39;, valid_tweet) # split on all whitespace characters disaster_count = 0 not_disaster_count = 0 # we can just reuse &quot;disasters&quot; and # &quot;not_disasters&quot; from earlier! for disaster_row in range(len(disasters)): disaster_tweet = disasters.loc[disaster_row, &#39;text_count_5&#39;] tokenized_disaster_tweet = re.split(&#39; s+&#39;, disaster_tweet) if model.wv.n_similarity(tokenized_valid_tweet, tokenized_disaster_tweet) &gt; 0.7: disaster_count += 1 for not_disaster_row in range(len(not_disasters)): not_disaster_tweet = not_disasters.loc[not_disaster_row, &#39;text_count_5&#39;] tokenized_not_disaster_tweet = re.split(&#39; s+&#39;, not_disaster_tweet) if model.wv.n_similarity(tokenized_valid_tweet, tokenized_not_disaster_tweet) &gt; 0.7: not_disaster_count += 1 if disaster_count &gt; not_disaster_count: valid.loc[valid_row, &#39;prediction&#39;] = 1 end_time = time.time() print(f&#39;Runtime: {(end_time - start_time) / 60.0} mins&#39;) .

(0.6554621848739496, 0.3180873180873181) . SpaCy again comes in the middle of our three tests with an accuracy of 65.55% and F1 score of 0.32. . Among the three datasets trained with a Word2Vec model, the &quot;simple&quot; tweets seem to have it again with an accuracy of 68.59% and an F1 score of 0.45. . Lastly, let&#39;s turn to transfer learning. . Transfer Learning with fastai . from fastai.text.all import * . Rather than create our own neural network from scratch that competes with something like Word2Vec, we can use transfer learning to quickly adapt our language data by using a model that&#39;s already been trained on a lot more data than just what we have. . From Jason Brownlee: . Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. . In order to perform transfer learning, we&#39;ll be using fastai. Fastai is great because it really simplifies the training procedure, thereby making it super easy to perform an array of deep learning tasks. We&#39;ll need two classes from fastai to conduct transfer learning with text: language_model_learner and text_classifier_learner. The former will allow us to shape the pretrained model with our own data to make a new language model, while the latter will allow us to create a classifier model for the tweets we have (the same task we&#39;ve been doing above). . Let&#39;s start, per usual, with the unprocessed tweets. . Transfer Learning with Unprocessed Tweets . Fastai uses PyTorch under the hood, which requires our data to be formatted in a specific way. In order to do this most efficiently, we can use fastai&#39;s DataBlock object and .dataloaders() method. With DataBlock, we can: . Directly pull our columns from the dataframe that we&#39;d like to train and test on. | Split the data however we&#39;d like. | And more! | Let&#39;s start by creating a DataBlock that we&#39;ll pass to language_model_learner to create a new language model tailored to our data. . dls_lm = DataBlock( blocks=(TextBlock.from_df(&#39;text&#39;, is_lm=True)), get_items=ColReader(&#39;text&#39;), splitter=RandomSplitter(0.1) ).dataloaders(data, bs=128, seq_len=80) . Note that there is only one block in the DataBlock we just created: a TextBlock. All we need to create a language model is the text (we don&#39;t care about the categories yet), so we only need one block in the DataBlock. We also need to specify the parameter is_lm=True when creating the TextBlock, to specify that this is our language model. . Now we can use .show_batch() to take a look at our newly formatted data: . dls_lm.show_batch(max_n=2) . text text_ . 0 xxbos xxmaj investigators shift focus to cause of fatal xxmaj waimate fire http : / / t.co / xxunk xxbos xxunk - old xxmaj baby xxmaj girl was xxmaj rescued by xxmaj xxunk after xxmaj she xxmaj floated xxup half a xxup mile xxmaj out to xxmaj sea ! # socialnews http : / / t.co / xxunk xxbos xxunk xxunk xxunk xxmaj joe ur so xxunk u should run 4 president xxmaj ur perfect ! the xxmaj american people | xxmaj investigators shift focus to cause of fatal xxmaj waimate fire http : / / t.co / xxunk xxbos xxunk - old xxmaj baby xxmaj girl was xxmaj rescued by xxmaj xxunk after xxmaj she xxmaj floated xxup half a xxup mile xxmaj out to xxmaj sea ! # socialnews http : / / t.co / xxunk xxbos xxunk xxunk xxunk xxmaj joe ur so xxunk u should run 4 president xxmaj ur perfect ! the xxmaj american people love | . 1 in xxmaj xxunk http : / / t.co / xxunk xxbos xxunk n xxmaj parents of xxmaj colorado theater shooting victim fear copycat massacre n n http : / / t.co / lvlh3w3awo n # xxmaj antioch n n http : / / t.co / viwxy1xdyk xxbos xxmaj xxunk : xxunk : 10th xxmaj december 2013 xxmaj green xxmaj xxunk in xxmaj xxunk for the xxmaj swiss xxmaj xxunk of xxmaj the xxmaj desolation … http : / / t.co / xxunk | xxmaj xxunk http : / / t.co / xxunk xxbos xxunk n xxmaj parents of xxmaj colorado theater shooting victim fear copycat massacre n n http : / / t.co / lvlh3w3awo n # xxmaj antioch n n http : / / t.co / viwxy1xdyk xxbos xxmaj xxunk : xxunk : 10th xxmaj december 2013 xxmaj green xxmaj xxunk in xxmaj xxunk for the xxmaj swiss xxmaj xxunk of xxmaj the xxmaj desolation … http : / / t.co / xxunk xxbos | . We can now instantiate our language_model_learner using the DataBlock we just created and AWD_LSTM which is a pretrained model provided by fastai. You can learn more about AWD_LSTM here. . learn = language_model_learner( dls_lm, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.3, metrics=[accuracy, Perplexity()]) . All that&#39;s left to do is fit our language model! . You&#39;ll note that fastai also provides super clear, customizable output for each training cycle. . learn.fit_one_cycle(1, 2e-2) . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy perplexity time . 0 | 4.491828 | 3.658581 | 0.387017 | 38.806240 | 01:48 | . learn.fit_one_cycle(10,2e-3) . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy perplexity time . 0 | 3.770010 | 3.639670 | 0.388401 | 38.079266 | 01:46 | . 1 | 3.734939 | 3.569396 | 0.392728 | 35.495167 | 01:50 | . 2 | 3.692173 | 3.482843 | 0.399855 | 32.552151 | 01:44 | . 3 | 3.618958 | 3.413075 | 0.409730 | 30.358452 | 01:44 | . 4 | 3.560955 | 3.363452 | 0.415191 | 28.888756 | 01:46 | . 5 | 3.494952 | 3.328071 | 0.418787 | 27.884504 | 01:46 | . 6 | 3.442179 | 3.305729 | 0.423154 | 27.268423 | 01:45 | . 7 | 3.399147 | 3.295249 | 0.424829 | 26.984131 | 01:46 | . 8 | 3.362297 | 3.289747 | 0.425076 | 26.836067 | 01:44 | . 9 | 3.334519 | 3.288971 | 0.425076 | 26.815262 | 01:44 | . The accuracy above represents the models ability to predict the next word in a sequence from our disaster tweets data. 42.51%! That&#39;s pretty dang good for something that took about the same time as our Word2Vec models. . But we&#39;re not after text prediction, we&#39;re after text classification. Let&#39;s turn to that now. . First, let&#39;s create a DataBlock that we&#39;ll pass to text_classifier_learner. Notice that now we&#39;re passing two blocks to the blocks parameter: TextBlock and CategoryBlock. We specify these with the get_x and get_y parameters. It is also important to note the new TextBlock parameter vocab. Without this, the language model fitting we did above will mean nothing! . dls_clas = DataBlock( blocks=(TextBlock.from_df(&#39;text&#39;, vocab=dls_lm.vocab, seq_len=80), CategoryBlock), get_x=ColReader(&#39;text&#39;), get_y=ColReader(&#39;target&#39;), splitter=RandomSplitter() ).dataloaders(data, bs=128, seq_len=80) . /opt/miniconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/numpy/core/_asarray.py:83: VisibleDeprecationWarning: Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences (which is a list-or-tuple of lists-or-tuples-or ndarrays with different lengths or shapes) is deprecated.

Now it&#39;s time to create our text classifier model, again using transfer learning from the AWD_LSTM model provided by fastai. This time we want to see the accuracy and F1 score when testing on the validation set. . learn = text_classifier_learner(dls_clas, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.5, metrics=[accuracy, F1Score()]) . Now we can fit: . learn.fit_one_cycle(1, 2e-2) . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy f1_score time . 0 | 0.749260 | 0.501972 | 0.770039 | 0.688612 | 00:45 | . And that&#39;s. It. . Crazy, right?! One last step that we need to take care of to inch our models accuracy up further is gradual unfreezing. Unfreezing a few layers at a time seems to make a real different in NLP, so we&#39;ll do that here (in computer vision, the model will often be unfrozen all at once). . learn.freeze_to(-2) learn.fit_one_cycle(1, slice(1e-2/(2.6**4),1e-2)) . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy f1_score time . 0 | 0.651064 | 0.493843 | 0.783837 | 0.728772 | 00:56 | . learn.freeze_to(-3) learn.fit_one_cycle(1, slice(5e-3/(2.6**4),5e-3)) . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy f1_score time . 0 | 0.547001 | 0.461932 | 0.795007 | 0.724868 | 01:35 | . learn.unfreeze() learn.fit_one_cycle(2, slice(1e-3/(2.6**4),1e-3)) . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy f1_score time . 0 | 0.495468 | 0.445766 | 0.800263 | 0.731922 | 02:13 | . 1 | 0.473490 | 0.442739 | 0.808147 | 0.749141 | 02:15 | . After fully unfreezing and fitting our model, our accuracy is... 80.81%! Over 11% better than our best Word2Vec! Impressive. Our F1 score of 0.749 also blows away our best Word2Vec F1 score of 0.450. Impressive, indeed. . But how will transfer learning perform will the preprocessed tweets? Let&#39;s find out! . Transfer Learning with &quot;Simple&quot; Tweets . In order to repeat the same process for transfer learning on the preprocessed tweets, we&#39;ll need to create a whole new language model for each set. This is done almost exactly in the same way as above. The two differences are: . The column that your selecting from will change from text to text_simple or text_spacy. | The get_x parameter when creating the DataBlock for the text_classifier_learner, dls_clas, must remain text, no matter the name of the column in the DataFrame that you are using as the independent variable.

Accuracy: 78.19%. F1 score: 0.713. . Whoa! These are the lowest of the three of our transfer learning models. How unexpected. . So between the three datasets used in transfer learning, the unprocessed dataset seemed to perform the best! Unexpected, indeed. . Conclusion . Now that we&#39;ve gone through each model: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and transfer learning, it&#39;s time to compare the results: . Model Dataset Accuracy F1 Score . TF-IDF | Unprocessed | 62.08% | 0.484 | . &#39;&#39; | &quot;Simple&quot; | 67.44% | 0.556 | . &#39;&#39; | SpaCy | 65.60% | 0.499 | . Word2Vec | Unprocessed | 64.08% | 0.274 | . &#39;&#39; | &quot;Simple&quot; | 68.59% | 0.450 | . &#39;&#39; | SpaCy | 65.55% | 0.318 | . Transfer Learning | Unprocessed | 80.81% | 0.749 | . &#39;&#39; | &quot;Simple&quot; | 78.58% | 0.733 | . &#39;&#39; | SpaCy | 78.19% | 0.713 | . And the winner is, unsurprisingly, transfer learning! What is surprising, however, is that of the three datasets that we used for transfer learning, the unprocessed dataset yielded the best results. This provides strong support for transfer learning, as it is able to extract nuances in natural language as opposed to augemented, unnatural language. . If you&#39;re interesed in getting more involved with transfer learning, I strongly recommend Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas&#39; course Deep Learning for Coders. At the time of writing, this is an excellent resource for getting a really good, modern grasp of deep learning, provided you&#39;ve got some basic Python programming experience. And it&#39;s all free! . With that, I&#39;ll leave the reader to experiment further with text classification and langauge modeling. . Questions I&#39;m now asking myself: . What other preprocessing methods or data augmentations techniques could we have used? | What&#39;s a transformer? | How does BERT work? | Where else can we apply text classification to somehow learn something meaningful? | .",
