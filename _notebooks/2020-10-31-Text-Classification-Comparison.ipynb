    "Text Classification is the assignment of a particular label to a text with respect to its content. In modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), there are many different algorithms and techniques used to gain significant accuracy in text classification tasks.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will cover three of the most popular methods for text classification: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and transfer learning. For each of the three methods, we will also show their effectiveness based on the amount of preprocessing that is done to the text beforehand, leaving us with a total of nine measurements at the end.\n",

This turns out to be quite useful in NLP. Consider the phrase \"New York Times\". When all three words are together, the phrase is understood to mean the widely spread news source based in New York of the same moniker. However, if we split the words up (while maintaining original order), we get: \"New York\", \"York Times\", \"New\", \"York\", and \"Times\". These separate words and phrases can occur in many contexts other than those in which the full phrase \"New York Times\" is found, skewing the phrase's true meaning in the data. N-gram models allow us to concatenate these commonly occurring multi-word phrases in our data, allowing their true meaning to shine through.\n",

You can think of a word vector as a 1-dimensional matrix of numbers of some arbitrary length computed by neural networks. Word similarity is then determined by the [cosine distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word vectors, interestingly, can encode linguistic regularities and patterns. Therefore, many of these patterns can be represented as linear translations. For example `vector(king) - vector(man) + vector(woman)` is going to very close to `vector(queen)`. This is surprising!\n",

    "We'll be using gensim's Word2Vec module, which processes text using a `min_count` parameter. This parameter only includes words in the input that occur more than the set `min_count` number of times. This will cause problems later on when trying to classify the tweets in the validation set because some of the words will have occurred less than the `min_count` parameter, throwing an \"out-of-vocabulary\" (OOV) error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to remedy this, we have two options:\n",
    "1. Train the Word2Vec model and then remove the words from the validation tweets that are not in the trained vocabulary.\n",
    "2. Preemptively change the words in our corpus that occur less than the expected `min_count` number of times with some sort of \"unknown\" character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these methods alter the original tweet that we'll be classifying, but the latter option seems to adhere closer to the original meaning of the tweet. If we drop words, we could make an entirely new sentence with an enitrely new grammatical structure and meaning. Whereas if we replace the words that occur less than `min_count` amount of times with an unknown character, the original grammatical structure of each sentence is held in tact, creating a closer tie to the tweet's original meaning.\n",
